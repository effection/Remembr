Remembr
=======

Remembers the last viewed post on your Tumblr dashboard in case you accidentally navigate away

What do I do if I've accidentally clicked a link and want to go back to where I was?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the same tab go back to Tumblr and left click the Remembr button, it will start searching for the last post you had open in THIS tab.

What do I do if I've accidentally closed my tab/browser and want to go back to where I was?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Just open a new tab/browser and click the Remembr button, this will show a popout of possible last posts (one for each tumblr tab you had open).

How can I show the list of possible last posts manually?
----------------------------------------------------------

Alt+Click the Remembr button and it will show the possibilities.

How can I tell Remembr to forget all of lasts posts it has stored
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Alt+Click the Remembr button to show the list of possibilities and click the 'x' item in the list. This will ask you to confirm that you want to delete all remembered posts.
